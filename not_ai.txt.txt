Albert Camus once wrote, "at the very bottom of life, which seduces us all, there is only absurdity, and more absurdity." In other words, we live in a chaotic universe devoid of truth, a theme that Robert Bolt's play, A Man For All Seasons, best demonstrates through the fates of two characters, Sir Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell. Sir Thomas More is an example of how no matter how good you are, there is no guarantee of reward. At the same time, Thomas Cromwell is rewarded for his actions despite only thinking and acting out of his self-interests, no matter how harmful his choices are to others.
